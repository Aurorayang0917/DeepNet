DeepNet: **Deep** learning model for predicting HLA-epitope interaction based on **Net**work analysis by harnessing binding and immunogenicity information

In DeepNet model, both binding intensity of HLA-peptide pairs and potential immunogenicity of epitopes which are capable of eliciting CD8+ T cell responses were considered. Two models: binding model and immunogenic model, were combined together to make final prediction.
