# DeepNet
**DeepNet**: _Deep_ learning model for predicting HLA-epitope interaction based on _Net_ work analysis by harnessing binding and immunogenicity information

In DeepNet model, both binding intensity of HLA-peptide pairs and potential immunogenicity of epitopes which are capable of eliciting CD8+ T cell responses were considered. In addition, to improve model accuracy, network centrality metrics were extracted through network construction which proved to possess sufficient prediction power in comparison. Extensive tests on independent and benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepNet can significantly outperform other well-known binding prediction tools. Furthermore, we confirmed performance enhancement of combined binding + immunogenic models on neoantigen identification by increased positive predictive value (PPV) and proportion of neoantigen recognition.
